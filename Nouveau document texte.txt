this is a class diagram it will show us the object and the attributes that we will 
deal with throughout our project realisation.

the doctor have many disponibilities

a patient have a course witch is decomposed into many steps 

then for any step we can have one or serval treatements.




now we will see some system sequencies diagrams that will help us to show the interractions between
different users and the system as an encapsulation of all the features.
